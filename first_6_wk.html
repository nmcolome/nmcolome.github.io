      <h2>My first 6 weeks of coding</h2>
      <p>I want to start from the beginning. Like the best things in my life, I just happened to stumble upon coding.
      With every year of my professional career that passed, I figured 'there must be a better way to go about this', so I used Excel, I learned Visual Basic, I learned tricks... it helped... kinda.</p>
        <p>When I was younger I didn't quite understand what computer science or software development involves, I had a terrible class in my first year of college about computer science or coding, I don't even know what it was supposed to be, and I thought this wasn't for me.</p>
        <p>Last year, my boyfriend wanted to change his career and was very interested in programming, and instead of doing online courses he wanted something more structured, so there was this Try Turing weekend and we thought why not. I just tagged along.</p>
        <p>I fell in love.</p>
        <p>With the school, the community, and with programming. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bed of roses, far from it. This thing is so $%^@# frustrating but I love every minute of it.</p>
        <p>One thing that embodies this new life I found in coding, is TDD. TDD means Test Driven Development which basically is instead of start coding right out the bat, write tests, let them fail, and allow the errors to tell you what to do. It's a great approach, it helps your code be cleaner, you are sure everything works (or doesn't) and it helps you layout a structure of what you need to do. </p>
        <p>The other advantage that no one tells you is your computer is constantly telling you how wrong you are, so you get used to being wrong. I know it doesn't sound good, but it is.</p>
        <p>Failing every day teaches you to persevere, to stay positive and to accept that this is a process; some things will click, others not so much. And it's ok</p>
      <p>So I guess that's my message. Coding isn't for the faint of heart, it will teach you through pain, but because of it, you'll end up growing so much more. Every line is worth it.</p>
