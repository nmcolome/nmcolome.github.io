    <h1>My first 6 weeks of coding</h1>
    <p>I want to start from the beginning. Like the best things in my life, I just happened to stumble upon coding.</p>
    <p>With every year of my professional career that passed, I figured 'there must be a better way to go about this', so I used Excel, I learned Visual Basic, I learned tricks... it helped... kinda.
      When I was younger I didn't quite understand what computer science or software development involves, I had a terrible class in my first year of college about computer science or coding, I don't even know what it was supposed to be, and I thought this wasn't for me.
      So, last year, my boyfriend wanted to change careers and was very interested in programming, and instead of doing online courses he wanted something more structured, so there was this Try Turing weekend and we thought why not. I just tagged along.
      I fell inlove.
      With the school, the community, and with programming. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bed of roses, far from it. This thing is so $%^@# frustrating but I love every minute of it.
