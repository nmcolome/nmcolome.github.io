        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Former industrial engineer turned software developer. I highly value finding challenges that push me to learn fast and adapt to new ways of approaching problems. The teams I work with report that my desire to find clean, efficient solutions, paired with my ability to stay positive under pressure have made our projects successful.</p>
        <p>While my current knowledge will enable me to hit the ground running and contribute to any team I join, I’m seeking the opportunity to learn from my peers and to continue growing as a professional. I have experience working in many multicultural teams and enjoy the opportunity to collaborate with others to produce exceptional work.</p>
        <p>I want a company where learning and taking risks are valued. I want to work where people have ownership in their work, their process, and their results. In return, I offer that company my unflagging enthusiasm for DRY and reusable code, my years of experience working with high-level business analytics, and my ability to absorb and apply new skills quickly and effectively.</p>
